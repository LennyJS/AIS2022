A basic ER model is composed of entity types (which classify the things of interest) and specifies relationships that can exist between entities (instances of those entity types).\n","\n","The main components of an ER Model are:\n","- Entity: Entirety of similar objects\n","- Relationship: Entirety of relationships between object\n","- Attribute: Property of an entity or relationship type\n","    - Key attributes uniquely identify an entity\n","- Cardinalities: The number of times an entity of an entity set participates in a relationship\n","\n","<span style=\"color:red\">***Your turn***</span>\n","\n","****\n","\n","## 2.

To this end, vaccination centers are established. Vaccination centers handle a multitude of processes and interact with numerous partners:\n","\n","- Appointments specify a certain date-time and are identified by an ID. They use a dose and serve a patient. Furthermore, successful completion of an appointment has to be tracked.\n","- Doses are characterized by the production lot which in turn specifies the ID, the manufacturer and the date-time.\n","- Patients provide their contact information and their social security number.\n","\n","Please create an Entity-Relationship diagram that captures this information about the vaccination process. Be certain to indicate cardinality constraints as well as primary keys (underline attributes).\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"9eaefd19","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-02T12:45:08.972307Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-02T12:45:08.969394Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-02T12:45:09.102546Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-02T12:45:09.100741Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.141217,"end_time":"2022-05-02T12:45:09.102734","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-05-02T12:45:08.961517","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["# Sketch your ERM Model here\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","# ... or somewhere else!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fed1992d","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.002988,"end_time":"2022-05-02T12:45:09.108786","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-05-02T12:45:09.105798","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## 2.1.
