To this end, vaccination centers are established. Vaccination centers handle a multitude of processes and interact with numerous partners:\n","\n","- Appointments specify a certain date-time and are identified by an ID. They use a dose and serve a patient. Furthermore, successful completion of an appointment has to be tracked.\n","- Doses are characterized by the production lot which in turn specifies the ID, the manufacturer and the date-time.\n","- Patients provide their contact information and their social security number.\n","\n","Please create an Entity-Relationship diagram that captures this information about the vaccination process.

An Airline owns multiple aircrafts, which are each identified by a unique aircraft registration. Each aircraft is of a specific aircraft type, identified by the manufacturer and model.

For every route and departure time of every airline there is one unique flight code which can be assigned to a specific flight only once a day. Airports are identified by an airport code.
